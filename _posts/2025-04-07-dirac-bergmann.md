In anticipation of my goal of understanding the ADM formalism to pursue numerical relativity, I decided to revisit Hamiltonian field theory, which ultimately led me to explore the Dirac–Bergmann algorithm. This post gathers the notes that arose from that effort, along with reflections on the process I followed to learn about the topic.<!--more-->

My study strategy was very much iterative and exploratory. I began by reviewing material I already knew reasonably well—mechanics and Lagrangian field theory—which soon raised new questions about how one might generalise the construction of a Hamiltonian to the field-theoretic setting. This, in turn, brought me to the topic of constraints.

Rather than relying heavily on textbooks, I preferred to work through my own questions with pen and paper, turning to ChatGPT whenever I found myself stuck or in need of additional context. Throughout, I tried to remain critical of whether I truly understood each step, constantly probing my grasp by formulating and tackling fresh questions. Writing down the results of this process has left me with a kind of informal documentation of my explorations, which might prove helpful to others grappling with similar lines of thought.

The notes start by walking through Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, before moving on to field theories. In each case, the Lagrangian formulation is introduced first, and the Hamiltonian picture is then derived via Legendre transforms. I frequently include examples to help illustrate the central ideas. Along the way, one particular discovery is that the Maxwell Lagrangian,
\\[
\mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu},
\\]
is singular. Such cases require a more general treatment than the straightforward Legendre approach, prompting a detour into the theory of constraints—first in mechanics, then in field theory—to lay the groundwork for introducing the Dirac–Bergmann algorithm.

Although there is still much more for me to understand about the Dirac–Bergmann procedure, engaging deeply with it and compiling these notes has given me a far clearer sense of its conceptual underpinnings, its intuition, and how it can be applied concretely to specific field theories.
