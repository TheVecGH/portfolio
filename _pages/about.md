# About Me

Hi! Glad you made it here. I'm Niels Slotboom, a theoretical physicist with a broad range of interests in and around the vast field of gravitation. Ever since I realised how precisely mathematics can describe the physical universe—and how computers can help extract concrete insight through computation and simulation—I've been driven to understand as much of these domains as I can. This website exists to document that journey.

## Academic Background

My academic path began at the University of Bern, Switzerland, where I completed both my bachelor's in physics and my master's in theoretical physics. Alongside the core physics curriculum, I developed a growing appreciation for the structure and rigour of mathematics, which led me to take a number of additional courses in that field.

Among the most formative experiences were the lectures on classical field theory and general relativity by Matthias Blau. These sparked my enduring interest in the geometry of spacetime and the mathematical structure of physical theories. I later wrote my master's thesis under his supervision, which gave me the opportunity to engage with relativity and gravitation more deeply and hands-on—an experience that cemented my conviction that this is the right field for me.

Parallel to my theoretical interests, I have cultivated a strong interest in high-performance computing, particularly using graphics processors and CUDA. My bachelor's thesis and various subsequent programming projects helped me build substantial proficiency in C++ and CUDA and gradually nudged me towards the direction of numerical relativity. This fusion of mathematical physics and computational methods is at the core of my current research interests.

The next step in my academic development will be the Part III course at the University of Cambridge, starting in Michaelmas 2025. I aim to further deepen my understanding of gravitation, geometry, and adjacent mathematical disciplines in preparation for a PhD in this field. 

## Research Interests and Career Vision

My current interests are broad, but centrally revolve around generalised theories of metrised gravity. Within this field, I am drawn to every layer of the problem—from the rigorous geometric foundations and analytical structures, to gravitational wave modelling and the concrete numerical methods and implementations required for simulating compact sources. With my upcoming studies in the Part III programme at Cambridge, and an already solid foundation in C++ and CUDA programming, I aim to bring together both the analytical and computational sides of gravitational research in my work.

It is my long-term goal to help bridge the gap between theoretical physics and high-performance computing. Specifically, I intend to develop a unified simulation framework for generalised gravitational theories: a tool capable of taking a symbolic Lagrangian as its input, performing constraint analysis to produce a Hamiltonian (or Ostrogradsky-type) formulation, and generating optimised kernel code that can be deployed as part of a modular backend on HPC clusters.

While I am fully aware of the theoretical and technical challenges such a system entails, I believe that even a partial realisation of this idea would be a meaningful contribution to the field. By lowering the technical barrier to numerically exploring extended theories of gravity, such a framework would empower fellow researchers without specialised HPC training to engage directly with simulation and phenomenology. Though I personally enjoy working in CUDA and C++, not every physicist does (or should)—so I see it as both a technical and conceptual responsibility to help build the infrastructure that makes broader participation possible.


## Other Projects and Interests
Outside of academia, I enjoy engaging with more hands-on, craft-oriented projects. Electronics has fascinated me since childhood—what began with assembling simple amplifier kits gradually evolved into more complex builds, such as designing and constructing my own mechanical keyboard, complete with a CNC-machined aluminium chassis. This interest often overlaps with my appreciation for metalworking, where I’ve taken to making rings and experimenting with small-scale fabrication techniques.

In my spare time, I also enjoy cycling—nothing too serious, but a welcome way to unwind and explore. Another long-standing interest of mine is photography. I’m particularly fascinated by the visual and optical characteristics of anamorphic lenses, which inspired me to build a small collection of images I'm especially proud of. A selection of my favourite photographs can be found on the [gallery page]( {{ site.baseurl }}/gallery/ ) of this website. I enjoy how these projects keep me curious in a different register.
